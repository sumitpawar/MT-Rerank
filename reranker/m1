" the effects of these cuts would be devastating to , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , make a cut , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine confidence in those who support our army and will damage alert . "
" even though military funding overseas contingency operations not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced , leading to опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , legal and political support will be broken . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , we can live with , and it 's not a solution , we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or the recent warnings of senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for the pentagon from cuts , will later .
at a press conference last week , secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what may be more troops -- with shell , but without the core .

a cursory glance at recent headlines showing how serious and повсеместны lies and deception in their daily lives .

former presidential candidate john edwards was charged with financial during the campaign укрывательством , extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on the tests in school and college is the norm .
coaches , to teach the opposite , they send a message that lies and fraud are .
in a single day , studies show that you can lie 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times in the first 10 minutes of each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim " caught ! " , lies is a serious of knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not from this hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars .
i spent a few years , the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and help in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men are more about yourself , whereas women -- the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe позой , laughing , voice of your target .
rats can secure the top of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " ... or repeat a complicated question .
someone can use the language " , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... i know . . . as far as i know . "
there is no magic means to identify , but the skill can detect deception .

if there is a topic that the decision which cannot be taken after a short discussion or by emotions , so it 's energy policy .
it is a healthy trend that the election meetings are cause for reflection on share and place their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinions on the objective facts and sound .
during the same period will be necessary to complete fossil resources to continue electricity production is growing deficit , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
that is why germany is one of its decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , the uk , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil is a few of those who strongly to their projects .
while the german model , based on the renewable energy , sometimes in as reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , which she gets 30 % of its electricity , it 's also the biggest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 % , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as the price of energy in a globalized economy is key to competitiveness and the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french company benefiting from cheaper electricity in europe .
price for the majority of french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose the kind of energy in general .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized in international trade in small and medium sized enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry .
one engineer and electrician would order epr , calculated to sixty years , if a planned closure of its maker ?
areva solutions low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , indicating взаимодополнимости .
in france we have the security , which monitors energy centers , too , and transparent , such as фламанвиль .
in 50 years , nuclear industry had three of the incident .
in chernobyl reactor and unforgivable mistake led to the tragedy .
the nuclear industry the lessons of this accident , learned of two .
as it is all specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , will halt its construction in фламанвиле magnificent gift rivals areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь to the leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when interior minister ( либерасьон " from france on may 23 , said that " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides as the immigration burden for french society and the french economy .
francois hollande was platitudes in his program , saying that " joint efforts will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of the immigrants based on the view that they can replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking falling wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and most skilled , dynamic sectors , where training not related to the proposals .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in a country where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity between local that the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and without taking into account the fact that this diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates high proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all founded immigrants ) .
according to labor organization , for example , in a german immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus costs an average of 150,000 euros .
the teeth , which used to scare immigrants , have exactly the opposite effect .

the european crisis that we are , is the economic crisis , but first , this political crisis and democracy .
we do n't win , demanding series of national referendums , organized by the need and хаотическом .
no , we are dreaming not edge the guillotine , but the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - on and democracy , this time on a european level .
europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty in europe , but the entire europe gradually lose sovereignty , and with each of its nations .
because only europeans working together can reduce the weight of debt each , from markets and prepare for future by investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal and jacques all socialists now require european economic government .
but to her without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in граздан , is another madness and new .
to establish a republic in france , you need to " create a republican .
this could only be done by a more democratic europe on the political level , this european sovereignty .
